# Food Vision 🍔👁️

This project is based on the Development of a model that can take in food images, and identify them. This repository is part of Milestone Project 1 for the Zero to Mastery Tensorflow Course 

## Modeling Experiments

Only 1 model will be created and improved throughout the notebook. This model uses a pretrained model known as `EfficientNetB0`. The model is something similar to the following :-   

`Input Layer`  -> `EfficientNetB0` -> `Global Average Pooling Layer` - > `Dense Layer`

## Datasets
The dataset used in this notebook is the `food101` dataset, that has 101 different classes of food. The dataset can be loaded using tensorflow datasets.
